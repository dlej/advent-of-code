# Advent of Code

This repository documents my attempts (with my personal inputs!) to solve the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) challenges.

Note: I somehow never heard of Advent of Code until 2024, so the first few days of 2023 are not a failed attempt, but rather a warm-up :)

## Approach

**Language:** I code all of my solutions in basic "numeric Python" - that is, standard libraries in Python + NumPy.
NumPy just makes working with grid-based data a lot easier, and often faster.
In the past, I've used challenges like [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) (where I've solved the first 128 problems ðŸ˜Œ) to learn new languages, 
but with a new challenge every (work) day, I need to leverage language familiarity as much as I can.

**Timing:** I usually go for speed of implementation rather than speed of execution, but execution time shouldn't be crazy. 
If it takes more than a few seconds to run, there's probably a much better way to do it, which I'll try to go for.
